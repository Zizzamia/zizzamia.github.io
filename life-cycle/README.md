# [The Secret Life(cycle) of Components](http://zizzamia.github.io/life-cycle/)
There is an entire world of complex interactions happening just under the surface of an Angular application. We can use lifecycle hooks to perform complex state management, coordinate control flow and finesse asynchronous events that would normally result in unpredictable and volatile results. 

We will start out by laying a solid foundation of what lifecycle hooks exist and when they happen in relation to each other. We will then anchor this knowledge in practical concepts that you can start using in your projects right away to help you make friends and influence people.

Then we will go into the Twilight Zone as learn how to manipulate Zone.js events, 3rd party events and how to use lifecycle hooks to bridge the gap between AngularJS and Angular.
